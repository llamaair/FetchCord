FetchCord API
-------------

FetchCord is a Discord API tool which you can use instead of pycord or discord.py for example.

At the current state, FetchCord isn't working that well, but in the future, it will be an easy to use/minimum programming skills required discord API.

With FetchCord, you won't have to code that much. For example, for a command, you can just use; @command, and for a cooldown @cooldown(seconds).

You can find a basic bot example in Packages - mainbot.py
Feel free to copy the code and use it, then just add the commands you want.
Just make sure it's named main.py, otherwise it won't work.
